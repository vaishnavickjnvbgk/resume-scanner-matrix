TO CHECK WHETHER THE ENETERED DIRECTORY EXISTS :

Dynamic Testing
a: Boundary Value Analysis
Boundary Value Analysis is a black box test design technique where instead of looking for faults in the
middle of the input, it looks for errors at the edges of the input domain (tests a program's behaviour
at the input boundaries).
Test case 1:
Checking that no other files except pdf are being extracted from the received mails .

.b: Mutation Testing
Mutation testing is a type of white box testing where testers modify some sections of an application's
source code to make sure a software test suite can recognise the changes.
3: Static Testing
Static testing involves validating your code without any execution. Under this problem statement, you
will be expected to analyse and calculate the cyclomatic complexity of your code.
